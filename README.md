## DFS and BFS Implementation
This repository contains implementations of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms, two fundamental graph traversal techniques.
## Description
### Depth-First Search (DFS):

A graph traversal algorithm that visits vertices as deeply as possible before backtracking.
Commonly implemented using recursion.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS):

A graph traversal algorithm that visits all the node of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the vertices at the same depth before going to the next depth.
Implemented using a queue.
